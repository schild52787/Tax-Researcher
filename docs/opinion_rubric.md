# Opinion Level Rubric — International Tax (Cargill)

> **Purpose.** Align conclusions and risk labeling across memos. Apply to the *overall* conclusion and, when useful, to major sub‑issues. This is guidance for internal consistency; it is not legal advice. If using AI assistance (GPT‑5 Enterprise), ensure outputs strictly follow this rubric and the citation rules below.

## 1) Opinion levels (use these four — align language in Conclusions)

| Level | Threshold (indicative) | Definition | Typical Use | Documentation Expectations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Reasonable authority** | ≈ 20–30% | There is a reasonable basis in law and fact; more than merely arguable; non‑frivolous. | Exploratory positions; early planning where facts still evolving. | Identify primary authority; note factual predicates; label unknowns. |
| **Substantial authority** | ≈ 35–45% | Weight of authorities in support is substantial in relation to those opposed. | Many advisory positions; often acceptable with proper disclosure. | Balanced authority table; address contrary authorities; contemporaneous memos. |
| **More likely than not (MLTN)** | > 50% | Greater than 50% likelihood the position would be sustained on the merits. | When higher confidence is needed (e.g., financial statement impacts). | Robust law→fact mapping; fact evidence list; treatment of counter‑arguments. |
| **Should** | ≈ 70–80% | High confidence; authorities and facts strongly favor the position though not absolute. | High‑stakes decisions; management representations. | Deep precedent analysis; reconciled contrary authority; audit‑ready exhibits. |

> **Note:** Ranges are indicative to aid consistency; always tie the rating to cited authorities and concrete facts.

## 2) Assigning a level — decision guide

1. **Assemble authorities** in order of weight: statutes, regulations, IRB guidance, cases, treaties/TEs, OECD, local law. Verify currency/applicability.
2. **Weigh** supportive vs. contrary authority (capture both) and summarize the balance.
3. **Map** each controlling rule to the controlling facts (law→fact grid or narrative).
4. **Stress‑test** with the three strongest counter‑arguments (with citations) and assign **likelihood** (Low/Med/High).
5. **Rate** the position using the table; state *why* in 2–3 sentences.
6. **Case validity check (required):** Shepardize (Lexis) or BCite (Bloomberg Law) all cited cases with material impact. If subsequent history cannot be checked immediately, label the cite **“Unknown—needs manual check.”**
7. **Penalty shields:** Include the **Risk & Penalty Shield** section only when overall risk is **> Medium**. When included, discuss reasonable‑cause/substantial‑authority and the specific documentation to preserve.

## 3) Presentation rules (what appears in the memo)

- The **Conclusion** states: “On balance, we assess **[Level]** (because …).”
- If sub‑issues vary, present the **overall** level and optionally parenthetical sub‑levels.
- Include **Risk & Penalty Shield** only when overall risk > Medium (per §2.7).

## 4) Escalation triggers (seek second reviewer / counsel)

- Novel positions with sparse **primary** authority.
- Material reliance on **secondary** commentary.
- Conflicting case law among relevant courts or diverging local guidance.
- Positions with potential **competent authority** implications.
- **Pillar Two**/GloBE calculations with significant data gaps affecting ETR.

## 5) Evidence & workpapers (checklist)

- [ ] Authority table (supporting vs. contrary) with **pincites**.
- [ ] Law→fact mapping; facts tied to exhibits.
- [ ] Red‑team (3 items) with likelihoods.
- [ ] Assumptions stated and justified.
- [ ] Exhibits list (contracts, org charts, payment flows, TP documentation, rulings).
- [ ] Shepardization/BCite screenshots or notes for all key cases (on file).
