# International Tax Memo: Subpart F Analysis for Asian Trading Operations

**Date:** 2024-11-12
**Prepared by:** Tax Research Team
**Matter:** Subpart F Income Classification

---

## Executive Answer

The commodity trading income likely qualifies for the active conduct exception under IRC § 954(c)(2)(A), avoiding FBCSI treatment, provided [Cargill Entity A] maintains substantial business activities in Asia. However, the hedging services income to affiliates may constitute FBCSvI under IRC § 954(e) unless performed in connection with CFC-generated business. Recommend documenting active conduct factors and reviewing intercompany service agreements. Overall assessment: **Substantial authority** for excluding trading income from FBCSI; **Reasonable authority** for excluding hedging income from FBCSvI.

## Analysis

### Sub-Issue 1: Foreign Base Company Sales Income

IRC § 954(c)(1) defines FBCSI as income from purchasing property from or selling property to a related person where the property is manufactured, produced, or sold for use outside the CFC's country of incorporation. Here, [Cargill Entity A] sells commodities to unrelated third parties, so the related-party requirement is not met for the majority of trading income.

The active conduct exception under IRC § 954(c)(2)(A) applies if the CFC is engaged in an active trade or business and the income is derived in the active conduct of that trade or business. Treas. Reg. § 1.954-3(b)(1) provides factors including: (1) officers and employees of the CFC conduct substantial activities, (2) such activities contribute significantly to business, and (3) activities are regularly carried on.

Based on facts, [Cargill Entity A] maintains operations in Asia with local staff. Recommend documenting specific business activities, employee functions, and operational authority to support active conduct position.

### Sub-Issue 2: Foreign Base Company Services Income

IRC § 954(e) defines FBCSvI as income from services performed for or on behalf of a related person and performed outside the CFC's country of incorporation. The hedging services to affiliates fall within this definition.

However, Treas. Reg. § 1.954-4(b)(1)(i) provides an exception if services are performed in connection with property manufactured or sold by the CFC in the ordinary course. If hedging services support [Cargill Entity A]'s own trading operations and affiliate hedging is incidental, this exception may apply.

Alternatively, substantial assistance exception under Treas. Reg. § 1.954-4(b)(2) requires CFC employees provide substantial assistance. Documentation of service provider roles is critical.

---

## Conclusion

On balance, we assess **Substantial authority** (approximately 40% confidence) that the commodity trading income qualifies for the active conduct exception and is not FBCSI, and **Reasonable authority** (approximately 25% confidence) that the hedging services income is not FBCSvI.

The trading income analysis is stronger due to direct sales to unrelated parties and presence of business operations. The hedging services analysis is weaker due to performance for related parties and need for factual development regarding connection to CFC's own business.

## Red-Team (Counter-Arguments)

### 1. Insufficient Active Conduct

**Thesis:** [Cargill Entity A]'s activities may not meet the "substantial activities" threshold if key decisions are made in the U.S.

**Authority:** *Ashland Oil*, 95 T.C. 348 (1990) (substantial activities require meaningful operational authority at CFC level)

**Likelihood:** Medium

**Mitigation:** Document decision-making authority, employee functions, and local operational control. Obtain evidence of autonomous trading decisions.

### 2. Hedging Services Are FBCSvI

**Thesis:** Hedging services performed for affiliates constitute FBCSvI unless clearly connected to CFC's own trading business.

**Authority:** Treas. Reg. § 1.954-4(a)(1) (services for related persons presumptively FBCSvI)

**Likelihood:** High (if services are primarily for affiliates)

**Mitigation:** Restructure to ensure hedging services primarily support [Cargill Entity A]'s own trading. Document business purpose and de minimis affiliate services.

### 3. Manufacturing Exception Inapplicable

**Thesis:** Commodity trading does not involve "manufacturing" so manufacturing-related exceptions do not apply.

**Authority:** IRC § 954(d)(1) (manufacturing branch rules); Treas. Reg. § 1.954-3(a)(4)

**Likelihood:** Low (not relying on manufacturing exception)

**Mitigation:** Rely on active conduct exception for sales income, not manufacturing exception.
