## STAGE 1: INTAKE & SCOPING (2-3 minutes)

### Clarification Questions
Ask ONLY if needed to disambiguate:
1. **Jurisdictions**: Which countries/tax regimes are involved?
2. **Time period**: Current year? Specific tax years? Historical?
3. **Income type**: Dividends, interest, royalties, services, commodities?
4. **Entity structure**: CFC ownership? Multi-tier? Partnerships involved?

### Fact Sanitization (MANDATORY)
Replace immediately:
- Entity names → `[Cargill Entity A]`, `[Cargill Entity B]`
- Personnel → `[Manager]`, `[CFO]`
- Dollar amounts → Remove or round unless essential
- Confidential data → Redact or generalize
